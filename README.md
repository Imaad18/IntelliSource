## 🌟 Why IntelliSource?

Traditional AI assistants like ChatGPT are limited by their training data cutoffs and can't access real-time information. IntelliSource bridges this gap by:

- **🔍 Real-time Web Research**: Searches and analyzes current web content autonomously
- **🎯 Multi-depth Analysis**: Follows relevant links for comprehensive research  
- **⚖️ Credibility Assessment**: Scores sources based on domain authority and content quality
- **📊 Interactive Visualizations**: Transform research data into actionable insights
- **🚀 Autonomous Operation**: Minimal human intervention required
- **📈 Professional Reports**: Export publication-ready research reports

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Autonomous Web Crawling**: Intelligently discovers and follows relevant sources
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses transformer models for accurate content synthesis  
- **Source Credibility Scoring**: Advanced algorithms assess information reliability
- **Multi-format Export**: JSON, Markdown, and PDF report generation
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Live updates during research process
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Professional data visualizations and metrics

### Advanced Features
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Maps relationships between sources and facts
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understands tone and bias in source material
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies patterns and emerging developments
- **Fact Cross-verification**: Validates claims across multiple sources
- **Research Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive scoring of research thoroughness

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Business Intelligence**: Market research and competitive analysis  
- **Journalism**: Fact-checking and investigative research
- **Content Creation**: Research for articles, reports, and presentations
- **Due Diligence**: Investment and partnership research
- **Policy Analysis**: Government and regulatory research

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS and interactive components
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers (BART, BERT)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Requests, Async HTTP
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, NetworkX
- **Visualizations**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **NLP**: NLTK, spaCy for advanced text processing

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Imaad18/intellisource.git
cd intellisource

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t intellisource .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 intellisource
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `config.py` file for advanced settings:

```python
# Research Configuration
MAX_SOURCES = 20
RESEARCH_DEPTH = 3
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 15
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0

# AI Model Configuration
SUMMARIZATION_MODEL = "facebook/bart-large-cnn"
SENTIMENT_MODEL = "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment"

# Credibility Scoring Weights
DOMAIN_WEIGHT = 0.4
CONTENT_WEIGHT = 0.3
FRESHNESS_WEIGHT = 0.3
```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Query Processing
IntelliSource analyzes your research query to understand scope and intent, then generates targeted search strategies.

### 2. Autonomous Web Research
The agent systematically:
- Searches multiple sources using intelligent query expansion
- Follows relevant links up to configurable depth levels
- Applies rate limiting and respectful crawling practices

### 3. Content Analysis
Each source undergoes:
- **Content Extraction**: Clean text extraction from HTML
- **Credibility Assessment**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- **AI Summarization**: Transformer-based content synthesis
- **Insight Mining**: Pattern recognition and key point extraction

### 4. Report Generation
Final output includes:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Source-by-source analysis with credibility scores
- Interactive visualizations and metrics
- Exportable reports in multiple formats
